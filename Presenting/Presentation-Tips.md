# Presentation Tips
* Before your talk:
  * By attending and speaking at our events, you are agreeing to follow the Techlahoma [Code of Conduct](https://www.techlahoma.org/code-of-conduct). Please read it before you speak.
  * Arrive a few minutes early to connect your laptop and run through your slides/code.
  * The `Starspace 46 guest` wi-fi password is `Techlahoma`. It would also be good to have a backup plan in case you have trouble connecting.
  * Make sure that you will be able to connect your laptop to the HDMI. If you need an adapter, please bring it or check with the user group leader or an A/V volunteer that one will be available. Don’t wait until your talk is starting to do this!
  * Verify that your **name, talk title, and a short summary** of your talk are listed correctly on the Meetup page for the event (even for lightning talks!).
  * Let the A/V volunteer know if you don’t want your presentation to be streamed or recorded. These are completely optional!
  * Let the A/V volunteer know whether the presentation contains audio/video, so that can be tested before your talk starts. Please be aware that copyrighted music cannot be played during the stream.
* During your talk:
  * Say your name and the title or a short summary of your talk at the beginning.
  * The crowd doesn't have a microphone! **Repeat questions before answering them.** This also helps you verify that you understood the question correctly.
  * Try to stay at the lectern so that you will be on camera. If you move away, take the microphone with you so that there will be audio.
* After your talk:
  * If your talk was streamed, a link to the broadcast will be available on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/techlahoma/videos/archive) for 60 days. A Techlahoma volunteer will save the video as a [highlight](https://www.twitch.tv/techlahoma/videos/highlight) and export it to [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/techlahoma). Please let an A/V volunteer know if you have any additions or corrections to make to the video descriptions, or if you don't want the video on Twitch or YouTube.
  * Consider adding your topic and/or bio to the Techlahoma [speaker list](https://github.com/techlahoma/user-groups/blob/master/SPEAKERS-AND-TOPICS.md)
  * Check the [Speakers Wanted Board](https://speakers-wanted.techlahoma.org/) for more opportunities to speak!

* Slides/Code
  * Dark themes are best for live coding.
  * Ensure text has a high constrast with background for legibility
  * Red and magenta are difficult to read on a black background.
  * When in doubt, increase your font size! Bigger is almost always better.
  * Assume 960x700 is a safe slide size.
  * Dark blues are hard to see for font.
  * Restrict 'fancy' fonts to headers unless the text is very large.
  * If your slide expresses multiple ideas, break it apart into more slides. Err on the side of being too sparse rather than too busy.
  * Disable blue light reduction tools like [Flux](https://justgetflux.com/).
