# Creating and Exporting Twitch Highlights
A Twitch highlight serves two purposes: 
1. Condensing the broadcast for export to YouTube.
2. Creating a permanent instance of the broadcast in Twitch to prevent expiration (14 days)

The following procedures outline the creation of a Twitch highlight.

* First fill out [this form](https://techlahoma.slack.com/archives/C03GE7DJ6/p1751995672418689?thread_ts=1751554540.964149&cid=C03GE7DJ6) to request editor access to Twitch and YouTube.
*  Reach out to Emily Harden and give her your twitch username, and she will give you access to create highlights on Twitch and upload videos on YouTube.

## Creating the Highlight

### 1. Go to the [Video Producer](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/u/techlahoma/content/video-producer) for the Techlahoma channel.

### Setting the Timestamps

#### 1. Find the exact times when the talk itself begins and ends. 

* Exclude the time before the talk (timer/countdown, leader introduction, announcements, etc). 
* You can keep up to 20 seconds of "dead" time at the end of the video. 
* **Use your best judgment** for any awkward time before the talk begins or during the Q&A. 
* When in doubt, it's better to keep more content. We can always remove more later, but we can never add it back.

#### 2. Set the **Start** and **End** timestamps. 

* After setting the timestamps, make sure the yellow preview bar updated correctly.
* Alternately you can pause the video at the desired start/end point and click the button next to the start/end timestamp fields to set 
* Check the calculated total video length on the left-hand side.

#### 1. Name the highlight using the following format:  
**`Talk Title - Speaker Name: Group Name`** 
* Remove `Highlight:` from the beginning of the title.
* Use the conference or event name if the talk is not for a specific group.
* The title **must be less than 100 characters**, or the export to YouTube will fail.

#### 2. Provide a Description: 
  
* Try to find the event on Meetup.com and use any details provided there. 
* Otherwise, write a short summary or use `<Speaker Name> talks about <Talk Title>.`

The highlight is now ready for export to YouTube.

## Exporting to YouTube

* A very clear keyword or set of keywords and phrases, separated by commas and without hashtags (spaces not required after commas), describing the content and how it would be searched. ( `Bootstrap, Creating a Portfolio Site` )
