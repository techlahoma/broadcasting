# Creating and Exporting Twitch Highlights
A Twitch highlight serves two purposes: 
1. Condensing the broadcast for export to YouTube.
2. Creating a permanent instance of the broadcast in Twitch to prevent expiration (60 days)

The following procedures outline the creation of a Twitch highlight.

* First provide your Twitch username to Dodzidenu Dzakuma, and he will give you access to create highlights on Twitch.

## Creating the Highlight

### 1. Go to the [Video Producer](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/u/techlahoma/content/video-producer) for the Techlahoma channel.

### Setting the Timestamps

#### 1. Find the exact times when the talk itself begins and ends. 

* Exclude the time before the talk (timer/countdown, leader introduction, announcements, etc). 
* You can keep up to 20 seconds of "dead" time at the end of the video. 
* **Use your best judgment** for any awkward time before the talk begins or during the Q&A. 
* When in doubt, it's better to keep more content. We can always remove more later, but we can never add it back.

#### 2. Set the **Start** and **End** timestamps. 

* After setting the timestamps, click the start and end inputs to update the yellow preview bar. 
* The highlights are actually taken from the preview bar, not the value that is in the start/end inputs.
* Check the calculated total video length on the left-hand side.

#### 1. Name the highlight using the following format:  
**`Talk Title - Speaker Name: Group Name`** 
* Remove `Highlight:` from the beginning of the title.
* Use the conference or event name if the talk is not for a specific group.
* The title **must be less than 100 characters**, or the export to YouTube will fail.

#### 2. Provide a Description: 
  
* Try to find the event on Meetup.com and use any details provided there. 
* Otherwise, write a short summary or use `<Speaker Name> talks about <Talk Title>.`

#### 3. Verify that the category is **`Science & Technology`**.

#### 4. Choose or add your own thumbnail (optional).

#### 5. Click **Save Changes**.

The highlight is now ready for export to YouTube.

## Exporting to YouTube

### 1. Go to the [Video Producer](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/u/techlahoma/content/video-producer) for the Techlahoma channel.

### 2. Find the highlight to be exported, and click `Export` in the 3 dots menu.

### 3. Add tags/keywords (optional).

* `Techlahoma`
* The group's name
* The speaker's name
* A very clear keyword or set of keywords and phrases, separated by commas and without hashtags (spaces not required after commas), describing the content and how it would be searched. ( `Bootstrap, Creating a Portfolio Site` )
* YouTube allows a maximum of 500 characters for Tags, including separators (`,` or `|`) and each tag can be a maximum of 30 characters.

### 4. Make sure you set the video to public not private. 

### 5. Do not break the video into segments.

### 6. Click `Start Export`. This process can take a while.

## Updating the Video on YouTube

If you have access to Techlahoma's YouTube channel:
* Set the thumbnail.
* Add the video to the relevant playlists (group, lightning talks, etc).
* Change category from `Gaming` to `Science & Technology` 

## Optional Follow-Up

* Consider messaging the speaker in Slack to send them a link to the video on YouTube and to thank them for speaking.
* If you have a Twitter account or access to the Twitter account for Techlahoma or the user group, consider tweeting a link and tagging the speaker.
